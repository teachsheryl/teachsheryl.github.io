I am Jack, a first year Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the National University of Singapore, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m9LF49sAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Justin Ker-Wei Yeoh</a>. My primary research focuses on leveraging and improving large language models and information retrieval techniques to automate code compliance for building regulations, with the goal of enhancing the design process in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the applications of computer vision and reinforcement learning in related domains. 

I am always on the lookout for challenging opportunities that push the boundaries of knowledge and possibility. On this page, I will share my research publications, projects, and experiences as I explore the intersection between engineering and artificial intelligence.
